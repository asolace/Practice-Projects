	<p>There was a time, long ago in the crystal forest where the saphire blue fountain hid. We marveled at it's incandescent beauty. We laid our lips upon the waters and we inherit it's curse. Addiction to it's waters and forever youth we remained.</p>
	<p>Till one dawn we awoke by a small rumbeling of the earth. We realized that the fountain that we had slept had disappeared.

	<p>Eons past yet we relentlessly search for it...</p>
