/*
You have 100 dogs (soo many dogs!). You have arranged all your dogs in a line.
Initially, none of your dogs have any bones. You take 100 rounds walking around
the dogs, always starting at the beginning. Every time you stop at a dog, you
put a bone in it's mouth if it doesn't have one, and you take away a bone if it
has one on (so cruel). The first round, you stop at every dog. The second round,
you only stop at every 2nd dog (#2, #4, #6, #8, etc.). The third round, you only
stop at every 3rd dog (#3, #6, #9, #12, etc.). You continue this process until
the 100th round (i.e. you only visit the 100th dog).

Write a program dogsAndBones() that prints which dogs have bones at the end.
